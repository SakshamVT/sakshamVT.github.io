          <h2>AI talking to AI: The Modern Job Application Cycle</h2>
          <p>A recent trend with applying to jobs has been a tiresome process of applying to hundreds of positions, and maybe only hearing back from a handful. The ability to apply to hundreds of positions, and on the other side, evaluate thousands of applicants for 
            just one position, is something that is made possible by the use of AI. This cycle of AI applications being
            reviewed by an AI powered system has created an almost unbreakable loop, for both students and recruiters.
            This post explores the issues with this topic and possible solutions to get out of this loop.

          <h2>Make your own rundown town - Cities Skyline</h2>
          <p>If you're interested in being mayor to your own metropolis, Cities Skyline is just for you. A game where you start on an empty plot of land with nothing, see if your policies transform the landscape to a utopia, or the slums.</p>

          <h2>How Sounds Effect Studying</h2>
          <p>In this episode, we discuss how sounds effect the ability of someone studying. We explore topics like using classical music, house music, white noise, and pure silence when studying, and how different people react to them. We also briefly discuss the impact the visual elements associated with a sound can have to how it impacts studying.</p>
